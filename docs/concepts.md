# DataNinja Technical Concepts

This document provides a detailed overview of the core technical concepts that power the DataNinja platform. Understanding these concepts will help you make the most of our platform's capabilities.

## Data Processing Model

### Stream Processing
DataNinja uses a stream-first approach to data processing. Data streams are the fundamental unit of processing in our platform, representing continuous flows of data that can be processed in real-time. Each stream can contain multiple data types and formats, and the platform automatically handles type conversion and validation.

### Batch Processing
While stream processing is our primary focus, DataNinja also supports efficient batch processing for historical data analysis. The platform automatically optimizes batch operations by:
- Partitioning data based on access patterns
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Parallelizing processing across multiple nodes

## Data Storage Architecture

### Distributed Storage
Our storage system uses a distributed architecture that ensures:
- High availability through replication
- Automatic failover
- Consistent performance across the cluster
- Efficient data distribution

### Storage Optimization
DataNinja implements several storage optimization techniques:
- Columnar storage for analytical queries
- Compression algorithms for different data types
- Automatic data tiering based on access patterns
- Smart caching strategies

## Query Engine

### Query Optimization
The DataNinja query engine includes sophisticated optimization techniques:
- Cost-based query planning
- Predicate pushdown
- Join reordering
- Materialized view selection

### Query Types
We support multiple query paradigms:
- SQL for traditional relational queries
- GraphQL for flexible data access
- Custom query languages for specialized use cases
- Natural language queries for business users

## Data Integration

### Connectors
DataNinja provides a wide range of connectors for different data sources:
- Database connectors (SQL, NoSQL)
